Hello World

1. Technical Steps:
1.1 Design
A server listens for new HTTP requests.
The requests are beeing handled in new threads.
If the requests do not contain any errors or wrong data, than the requests gets processed.
Important data is stored in a PostresSQL database.
When the request is finished or resulted in an error, than a response with according HTTP-Code and Message or Data is sent.

1.2 Failures
It was tried to implement a consistent connection with client for multible requests.
This concept was quickly dicarded, because the test client is one single curl script.
Also if one secure Socket connection would be mentained, than a Token based security would not be needed.

1.3 Connection listening

1.4 Client handler

1.5 DB structure

1.6 DB handling

1.7 Battle handling


2. Unit Tests
2.1 Card Tests
The Card Tests are used to test all the Attack functions.
Espacialy the damage calculation regarding different Element Types.
It is also tested that Spells can only be used as long as they have Uses left

2.2 User Tests
The User Tests are used to test all the functions that change Wins, Losses, Draws and Elo.
Espacialy the Elo change after winning, loosing or drawing vs a weaker oponent.

2.3 Battle Tests
The User Tests are used to test all the functions of the Battle class.
This includes Testing to start a Queue, Running the Battle, reading the Battle Log and checking Wins, Losses, Draws and Elo changes.
It is also tested what happens if
-) a User tries to join his own Battle as oponent.
